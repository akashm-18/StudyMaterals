1) sql query to find the nth highest salary

SELECT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY SALARY DESC       ---> OFFSET SKIPS THE NUMBER OF ROWS
LIMIT 1 OFFSET N-1;

2) delete the duplicate rows

WITH EMPLOYEECTC AS (
SELECT * , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY ID) AS ROWNUMBER
FROM EMPLOYEE
)

DELETE FROM EMPLOYEECTC WHERE ROWNUMBER > 1;

3) CHAR - VARCHAR

In SQL, both CHAR and VARCHAR are data types used for storing character strings, but there is a key difference between them:

CHAR: 
	It is a fixed-length character data type. When you define a column as CHAR(n), it will always occupy n characters of storage, 
regardless of the actual length of the data stored in the column. If the data is shorter than n characters, it will be padded with spaces.

CREATE TABLE ExampleTable (
    FixedColumn CHAR(10)
);

If you insert 'Hello' into FixedColumn, it will be stored as 'Hello ' (padded with spaces to reach the fixed length of 10).


VARCHAR: 
	It is a variable-length character data type. When you define a column as VARCHAR(n), it will only occupy the actual length 
of the data stored in the column plus two bytes for length information. No padding is added.

CREATE TABLE ExampleTable (
    VariableColumn VARCHAR(10)
);

If you insert 'Hello' into VariableColumn, it will be stored as 'Hello' (without any additional padding).
