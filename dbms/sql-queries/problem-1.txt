A database contains the names of Customers , their Accounts, Deposits and Loans
in the following format

CUSTOMER --> TABLE NAME 

Name        Type of Contract      Balance

Ganesh         Account             1000
Biju           Account              500
Ganesh          Loan               2000
Biju            Loan               5000
Ganesh         Deposit            10000


Produce a report as follows (Use a program or a SQL statement. No need to write a
program to create the data, assume that it is already available in the above table)

Name, Number of Accounts, Number of Deposits, Number of Loans, Holdings
(Sum of Positive Account Balances, Deposits), Borrowings (Sum of Negative
Account Balances, Loans), Positive/Negative (If Total of Holding is less than
Borrowings then Negative else Positive) and the Totals.
